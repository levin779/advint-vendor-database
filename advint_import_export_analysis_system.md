# Import-Export Data Analysis System for Product Identification

This document outlines a structured approach to optimize the intern's role in analyzing import-export data to identify potential pharmaceutical intermediate products that Advint can pitch to customers.

## Current Challenges

1. **Data Volume**: Large datasets make manual analysis time-consuming and inefficient
2. **Data Complexity**: Import-export data contains numerous fields and requires context to interpret
3. **Prioritization**: Difficulty in identifying which products represent the best opportunities
4. **Analysis Consistency**: Need for systematic approach to ensure no opportunities are missed
5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Ensuring insights are effectively communicated to the sales team

## Systematic Data Analysis Process

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preparation

**Data Sources:**
- Indian import-export databases (Zauba, Exim, etc.)
- Government customs data
- Industry reports with import-export statistics
- Subscription-based trade intelligence platforms

**Data Preparation Steps:**
1. Download raw data in structured format (CSV/Excel)
2. Create standardized template for data organization
3. Clean data (remove duplicates, correct errors, standardize units)
4. Organize by relevant categories (product type, origin/destination, volume, value)
5. Create pivot tables for initial analysis

**Data Organization Template:**
Create a master Excel workbook with the following structure:
- Raw Data Sheet: Original import-export data
- Cleaned Data Sheet: Standardized and cleaned data
- Product Category Sheets: Data filtered by relevant categories
- Analysis Sheets: Pivot tables and charts for analysis
- Opportunity Tracker: Log of identified opportunities

### 2. Structured Analysis Framework

**Three-Tier Analysis Approach:**

**Tier 1: Volume and Value Analysis**
- Identify high-volume imported intermediates
- Track products with significant value
- Analyze price per unit to identify high-value opportunities
- Look for consistent import patterns indicating stable demand

**Tier 2: Trend Analysis**
- Identify products with growing import volumes (year-over-year)
- Track products with increasing unit values
- Analyze seasonality patterns
- Identify new products appearing in recent data

**Tier 3: Strategic Analysis**
- Cross-reference with Advint's target product categories
- Analyze source countries to identify supply chain diversification opportunities
- Identify products with limited number of importers (potential niche opportunities)
- Look for alignment with therapeutic areas of focus

### 3. Prioritization Matrix

Create a scoring system to prioritize identified opportunities:

**Opportunity Score = (Volume Score × 0.3) + (Value Score × 0.3) + (Growth Score × 0.2) + (Strategic Fit Score × 0.2)**

Where each component is scored 1-5:
- Volume Score: Based on import volume relative to category average
- Value Score: Based on total import value and unit price
- Growth Score: Based on year-over-year growth rate
- Strategic Fit Score: Based on alignment with Advint's strategic focus areas

**Prioritization Categories:**
- High Priority (Score 4-5): Immediate opportunity development
- Medium Priority (Score 3-3.9): Secondary focus for development
- Monitoring (Score 2-2.9): Track for future potential
- Low Priority (Score <2): Document but no immediate action

### 4. Documentation and Reporting

**Product Opportunity Summary Template:**

```
